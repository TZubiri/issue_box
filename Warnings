Emitting a warning instead of an error is the act of foreseeing a scenario in which there can be a problem, but likely not, it's the act of a programmer notifying a user that their guarantee of quality cannot be maintained. Disabling a warning is the act of notifying to the program that the warning was heeded and understood but will be ignored, hopefully for good reasons. Ignoring a warning is the act of breaking a seal of warranty for a specific subset of issues.
